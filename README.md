# BarryPersonalWebsite
This is a working repository for the personal website of Lisa Barry.

The initial structure of this website is a Main/landing page, an About page, and a Portfolio page.  All will navigate to each other via links in the header and footer. All pages have css syling and a basic javascript functionality applied to them.
