# BarryPersonalWebsite
This is a working repository for the personal website of Lisa Barry.

The initial structure of this website is a Main/landing page, an About page, and a Portfolio page.  All will navigate to each other via links in the header and footer. All pages have css syling and a basic javascript functionality applied to them.

The main page has an embedded video from my professional portfolio Vimeo account.

The Portfolio page has additional webpages for more specific portfolio content. Current sub portfolios are my Game art portfolio and my Animation/Motion graphics portfolio. Current content for both only consist of embedded youtube videos from my current employeers youtube channel. These additional webpages can be navigated to via traditional text links or by clicking on the image vertical banners.
